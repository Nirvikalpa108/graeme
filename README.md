# üõçÔ∏è Fashion Product Search Pipeline (ML Ops Portfolio Project)

This project builds a **production-style ML Ops pipeline** that powers a hybrid **semantic + structured product search system** for an e-commerce use case.

---

## üîç Problem Statement

E-commerce platforms store rich structured data (e.g., product name, price, category) and unstructured data (e.g., descriptions, reviews, images). However, search functionality is often limited to keyword or filter-based systems, which fail to capture the **semantic meaning** behind user queries like:

> *‚ÄúShow me stylish travel bags for women under INR 2000.‚Äù*

This project solves that by:
- Ingesting and processing structured and unstructured data
- Creating embeddings from text descriptions using modern LLMs
- Storing structured data in a SQL database and embeddings in a vector database
- Allowing **natural language queries** that return semantically relevant, filterable results

## üß† Example Query Flow
User enters: "Red formal shoes under INR 3000"

Query is embedded into a vector

Vector DB retrieves top 10 semantically similar products

SQL DB filters for price, color, gender, etc.

Results are ranked + displayed via a UI

## üßæ Dataset

- **Source**: [Fashion Clothing Products Catalog ‚Äì Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/fashion-clothing-products-catalog)
- **Format**: CSV
- **Fields Used**:
  - `product_id`, `product_name`, `product_brand`, `gender`, `price_inr`, `description`, `primary_color`
- **Size**: ~12,000 products

---

## üß† Embedding Model

- [`sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2)  
  A lightweight transformer model for generating dense vector embeddings from product descriptions.

## üóÉÔ∏è Database Schema Design

To support both **semantic search** (via vector embeddings) and **structured filtering** (via SQL), this project uses a carefully designed PostgreSQL schema centered on a single `products` table.

### üéØ Design Goals

The schema is optimized to:

- Enable **joins** between structured data and vector search results via `product_id`
- Support **filtering** by key attributes like price, gender, and color
- Store metadata needed for **displaying relevant results**
- Stay flexible and clean for production-scale querying

---

### üß± Table: `products`

| Column          | Type     | Purpose                                      |
|-----------------|----------|----------------------------------------------|
| `product_id`     | INTEGER  | Primary key; used to join with vector DB     |
| `product_name`   | TEXT     | Display title for results                    |
| `product_brand`  | TEXT     | Useful for filtering or grouping             |
| `gender`         | TEXT     | Common filter (Men, Women, Unisex)           |
| `price_inr`      | INTEGER  | Used for price filtering or sorting          |
| `description`    | TEXT     | Unstructured text used to generate embeddings|
| `primary_color`  | TEXT     | Optional structured filter                   |

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Why This Works

- ‚úÖ **Simplicity**: Single-table design keeps queries fast and easy to debug  
- ‚úÖ **Searchable**: All common filters (gender, color, price) are first-class columns  
- ‚úÖ **Compatible**: `product_id` links to semantic search results from FAISS   
- ‚úÖ **Ready for Production**: Schema avoids unnecessary complexity (e.g., joins for color/brand)  

---

### üß† Example Use Case

When a user enters:

> ‚ÄúStylish red jackets under INR 3000 for women‚Äù

The app:

1. Embeds the query and performs a **nearest-neighbor search** on the vector database  
2. Retrieves the top matching `product_id`s  
3. Filters those using SQL:

```sql
SELECT * FROM products
WHERE product_id IN (...)
  AND gender = 'Women'
  AND primary_color = 'Red'
  AND price_inr <= 3000;
